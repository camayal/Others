## Mendeley or Zotero styles for some journals
Usually I modify (from other CSL) or create my CSL files for software like Mendeley for some journals:

[Phytotaxa](https://github.com/camayal/Others/blob/master/phytotaxa-biblio-32.csl)

[Systematic Botany](https://github.com/camayal/Others/blob/master/systematic-botany.csl)

[Taxon](https://github.com/camayal/Others/blob/master/taxon.csl)

[Nomenclature proposals in Taxon](https://github.com/camayal/Others/blob/master/Taxon-proposals.csl)
